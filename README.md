# Host-a-website-on-Amazon-S3
This project demonstrates how to host and manage a static website using Amazon S3. I created an S3 bucket, configured it for static website hosting, and uploaded website files such as index.html and error.html. To enhance security, I implemented a bucket policy that denied unauthorized deletion of files ensuring data integrity and access control.
